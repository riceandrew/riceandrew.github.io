        <p id="Text"> <img id="ProfilePicture" src="assets/images/IMG_1773.PNG">I live in Ausitn, TX with my fiancee and our two dogs. I currenty work at the City of Austin in the
            Historic Presrevation Office.
            Learning how to code is an interesting and new challenge to me that I would love to master.
            There are a very limited opportunities for improvment at the City of Austin, so I am eager to unlock my full
            potential.</p>

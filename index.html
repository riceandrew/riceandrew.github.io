            <img id="ProfilePicture" src="assets/images/IMG_1773.PNG">
            <p id="Text">I was born in Germany to a military family. I attended Texas State University where I have a
                degree in Political Science and Geography.
                I live in Ausitn, TX with my fiancee and our two dogs.
                I currenty work at the City of Austin in the
                Historic Presrevation Office.
                Learning how to code is an interesting and new challenge to me that I would love to master.
                There are a very limited opportunities for improvment at the City of Austin, so I am eager to unlock my
                full
                potential.</p>
